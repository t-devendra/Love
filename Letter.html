    <h1>Hey Aaruuuu,</h1>
    <p>
      <!-- Paste your real letter here -->
      <br><br>
   
      I really want to say this from my heart. I am truly sorry for what I said. I know my words hurt you, and I have been feeling terrible ever since. It has only been a day since we started this relationship, but I already managed to mess things up by overthinking and letting my emotions take over. You did not deserve that at all.<br><br>
The truth is, I care about you more than I can explain. Maybe that is why I started overthinking so quickly, because I was scared to lose you even before I got to know you fully. But in doing that, I ended up hurting the very person I wanted to protect. I should have trusted you, and I should have trusted what we were starting to build.<br><br>
I know saying sorry will not undo the hurt, but I promise I will learn from this. I will keep my words softer and my thoughts calmer. I will try to understand before reacting and talk things through instead of assuming. You deserve someone who makes you feel loved, not someone who hurts you with unnecessary doubts.
Please do not think that my mistake defines what I feel for you. You truly mean something special to me, and I do not want this small misunderstanding to become a wall between us. I want to grow with you, to learn from you, and to make this relationship something real and beautiful.<br><br>
I hope you can forgive me. I just want you to know that I care deeply, and I will do everything I can to make sure this never happens again.      <br><br>
      With all my love,<br>
      Yours Tiu-üíï  
    </p>

    <h1>     My love,</h1>
    <p>
      <!-- Paste your real letter here -->
      <br><br>

I am writing this slowly, like every word matters. Because it does. Because you do.    <br><br>

It has only been 24 days, and that fact almost scares me. Not because it is too soon, but because I already feel how deeply you have settled into my life. You did not arrive loudly. You arrived gently. And somehow, without asking permission, you became important.    <br><br>

I want to tell you something I usually hide. I am afraid of being abandoned. I am afraid of loving someone and waking up one day to realize I loved them more than they stayed. That fear is old. It did not begin with you. But you are the first person who made me brave enough to admit it out loud.    <br><br>

I am scared of losing you. Scared of the quiet that would follow if you ever left. Scared of the space where your messages live now. And maybe that sounds heavy, but it is honest. You matter enough to make me afraid. That is not weakness. That is love taking shape.    <br><br>

Even with the distance between us, you are present in my days. In my thoughts. In the small moments where I catch myself smiling for no reason and realize the reason is you. When something happens, good or bad, you are the first person my heart reaches for. That is how I know this is real.    <br><br>

I do not want to be temporary in your life. I do not want to be something you remember softly but leave behind. I want to be someone you choose. Not just when it is easy, but when it requires effort and patience and trust. I want to grow with you, even from far away.    <br><br>

On 11 January 2026, I want to stand in this feeling instead of circling around it. I want to choose you out loud. I want to ask you to choose me too. Not as a promise made in fantasy, but as something real and intentional and alive.     <br><br>

I cannot promise I will never be afraid. But I can promise that I will not disappear because of that fear. I will stay. I will try. I will love you honestly, even when it feels vulnerable.    <br><br>

You are more important to me than I expected, more than I planned for, more than I knew how to protect myself from. And still, I would choose you again.    <br><br>
Always,
Yours Laado. 
      
    </p>
